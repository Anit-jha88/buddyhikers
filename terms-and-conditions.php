                            <h1>Paying for Trek/Adventure Activities</h1>
                            <p>The purchase of any travel services offered by BuddyHikers (hereinafter referred to as ‘BuddyHikers’) constitutes a contractual arrangement between BuddyHikers (‘First Party’) and the Client (hereinafter referred to as ‘You’) (Second Party). Both Parties are hereinafter referred to as ‘Parties’. Booking services with BuddyHikers represent your unconditional acceptance of the terms & conditions set out herein. These terms and conditions shall be binding on you and all the travel companions booked by you.</p> <br />

                            <h3>Risk Acknowledgment:</h3>
                            <p>Trekking, Peak climbing, and mountaineering in the Himalayan region carry an inherent risk to the life and property of both Parties. The weather changes in minutes causing injury and death, which is beyond BuddyHikers’s control. BuddyHikers does its best to reduce all types of risks, discomfort, and hazard to the best of its ability (within financial constraints); however, there are chances of accidents, mishaps, and deficiencies in service. Therefore, you must agree with these terms and conditions. Please ensure that you read carefully and understand these terms before confirming your booking.</p>
                            <br />

                            <h3>Promotions:</h3>

                            <p>BuddyHikers offers trips and treks that require varying levels of fitness. The level of difficulty can be based on the extent of physical stress, terrain, weather, and/or climate. The degree of difficulty for some trips can be physically demanding. To enable you to choose appropriately and prepare accordingly, carefully review the level of difficulty of each trip before booking the same. </p>
                            <p>BuddyHikers is not a medical expert(s), and it is your responsibility to obtain medical advice and the latest health requirements, including inoculations and vaccines, before you join a trip. BuddyHikers takes no responsibility for your inability to cope with the level of difficulty on a trip. While most treks do not require specific preparation, a reasonable level of fitness adds to your experience. The onus of being fit, healthy, and in shape before getting on the trip rests with you. You are solely responsible for ensuring that you are ready for the trip in every way, including physical and mental conditioning. You are also expected to carry the right clothing and equipment. While there is no age limitation on any of BuddyHikers trips, any disability, pregnancy, mental or physical, or any other medical condition that may affect your fitness to complete the trek must be revealed at the time of booking the trip to BuddyHikers. You also undertake that you and Your travel companions, for whom You have signed up, do not suffer from any condition or disability that could create a hazard to your well-being or others on a trip.</p>
                            <p>Failure to share this information with BuddyHikers can result in immediate termination of your trip at any stage of the trip with a full cancellation penalty. BuddyHikers reserves the right to decline, accept, and/or remove from a trip any participant, at his or her sole expense, whose condition could create a hazard to any other member of the trip, including themselves.</p>
